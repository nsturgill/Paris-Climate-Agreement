Paris Climate Agreement Code, Powerpoint, and Data from 12/11/18

Question: 
What if any economic factors determine commitment levels in the Paris Climate Agreement? 
How do potential GDP damages affect our commitment predictions?


Background:
The Paris Climate Agreement was signed on April 22nd, 2016, at the conference in Le Bourget,
France and was put into effect on November 4th, 2016. At the original conference, 197 countries 
agreed to keep global temperature rise to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 
The agreement also included pledges to assist developing countries in reducing their greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions as well as to introduce new, low-emission technologies to help maintain 
low levels of GHGs. In order to achieve these goals participating countries must submit reports 
on both emissions and implementation efforts, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
